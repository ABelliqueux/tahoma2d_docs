"In OpenToonz, each Toonz raster and vector animation level comes with its"
" own palette containing styles that can be used to draw lines and paint "

"In Toonz levels, palette styles are interactively “linked” to drawn lines"

"that if you edit a style of the palette, all the lines and filled areas "
