"The Xsheet, the digital version of the traditional exposure sheet, allows"
" you to control the timing of all of the elements of a scene. It is "
"organized in columns and rows: each column contains a layer of the "
"animation and each row represents a frame contents. Columns are divided "
"into cells, representing the content of that column in a particular "
"frame."

"The Timeline is the horizontal counterpart of the Xsheet, it serves the "
